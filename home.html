    <p>This website is my personal online portfolio. The work shown here is was all for the CS50 Harvard course.<br>
    I had a great time doing the course, it was stimulating, and informative. I feel as if I am now a much more <br>competent programmer.</p>

    <p>The content shown is all C. We only did a handful of SQL and Py so there is not much missing.<br>
    At some point you are going to think <em>"why is most of this site formatted so elements are centered?"</em><br>
    I have a simple response, it's easy to format like that.</p>

    <p> I will also include my CCT on this page. My CCT is partly
    this portfolio, but also the server running it.<br> For the CCT I created a socket server in C. By binding onto a port routing traffic to a host, and <br>sending html content I was able to make my own frontend, and backend.</p>
