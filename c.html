    <p> These labs were the one that piqued my interest the most. I was new to c and printing formatted outputs, and<br> had never seen a dowhile before. These labs were very simple yet when their lessons are applied properly they are insanely useful.<br> This lesson was by far the easiest out of the bunch because it only covered programming basics, but it helped reinforced previous knowledge.</p>

    <p> The Mario More problem from pset1 was great. It was a great way to introduce/practice nested loops, and string formulation.<br>
    I did Mario More because it was literally like 3 lines longer than Mario Less so I thought why not.</p>
