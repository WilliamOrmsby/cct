    <p>Im displaying these because I thought they were very useful but overlooked labs. I constantly see classmates <br> struggle with
    exit codes, especially in functions. And typecasting turned out to be a very powerful tool.</p>

    <p>This problem was one of my favourites. I loved the way you had to handle ASCII values, and how it accounted for<br>
      capitalization, and even special characters. This was was also nice as it allowed me to better understand pointers<br>
    and better use arrays.</p>
