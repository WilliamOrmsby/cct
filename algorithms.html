    <p>This whole lesson was one of the toughest, but most rewarding. Selection and Insertion sort both seem dauting<br>
      atleast for me, but after a while you become more familiar with these algorithms, and learn to implement them easily.<br>
    The labs for this lesson were great, the problem on the other hand....</p>

    <p>This problem was one of my favourites. I loved the way you had to handle ASCII values, and how it accounted for<br>
      capitalization, and even special characters. This was was also nice as it allowed me to better understand pointers<br>
    and better use arrays.</p>
