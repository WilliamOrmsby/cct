# This is my CCT for the CS50 course we did. Inside my repo is all the html needed to run in, a style sheet, and my custom socket server framework.
# This server is ran at http://jameswoods.ddns.net, which then links to 4 other webpages, hosted by github.
# Thank you for teaching this course Mr.Michalenko, I would love to join your CS class next year. Peace.
